    <h1>Changelog</h1>
</header>
<div>
    <h3>3/10/24</h3>
    <p>(9:54 PM EST) - Added a lot this commit. Officially joined the Stella Ring yesterday so I added the links for the other people. I updated some of my
    CSS, and added this very page.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>3/9/24</h3>
    <p>(3:21 PM EST) - Added a download button for your generated YAML. Makes the process a lot easier.</p>
    <p>(4:40 PM EST) - Added Mario Kart 64 to the AP Parser page.</p>
    <p>(10:17 PM EST) - Tied the Miku Mode button to your browser cookies. It also works on every page.</p>
    <p>(10:40 PM EST) - Finally made a custom 404 page, I think it's very cool.</p>
    <p>(10:50 PM EST) - The Miku Mode cookies now expire after 1 year, instead of expiring after the session.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>3/6/24</h3>
    <p>(9:42 AM EST) - I added the random button onto the AP Parser page and also put some CSS on the page to make it look better.</p>
    <p>(10:25 AM EST) - Almost all options that are on all AP games were added to the Parser page. The beginning of actual YAML generation was also started
    here.</p>
    <p>(3:01 PM EST) - This update brought the actual YAML generation to the Parser page. It still had limited compatibility, but it functioned with the one
    game I tested it with.</p>
    <p>(5:15 PM EST) - Github Pages broke the site for the exact reason as before. I fixed it here.</p>
    <p>(8:37 PM EST) - I added more compatibility to the YAML generation. Almost all games should work now as long as the options aren't programmed oddly.
    (Fun Fact: every other world I try is programmed oddly)</p>
    <p>(8:50 PM EST) - Lethal Company was added to the list of games on the site. I was fixed some compatibility with certain worlds being programmed oddly.</p>
    <p>(8:54 PM EST) - I added A Hat In Time here, it worked fine on the local host, but on Github Pages it broke for the same reason as before. I love that
    Github Pages breaks things!</p>
    <p>(9:20 PM EST) - The random button now actually is acknowledged in YAML generation. I also added Inscryption.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>3/5/24</h3>
    <p>(12:32 AM EST) - The landing page is updated to have something on it (it was miku). The AP Parser page also had it's first prototype made, where it will
        display all the
    options from either Wario Land 4 or Ultrakill.</p>
    <p>(12:35 AM EST) - The list of options were printing in a solid blob, they now print in a nice list.</p>
    <p>(12:44 AM EST) - The initial prototype of the AP Parser was broken by Github Pages, this tried to fix that.</p>
    <p>(12:47 AM EST) - Reverted the fix I tried earlier. Turns out the problem was different from what I thought.</p>
    <p>(12:48 AM EST) - I actually fixed the problem here. My line creak insertion was placed wrong, makign the list of options look funky.</p>
    <p>(10:25 AM EST) - Both Range and Toggle options now displayed on the AP Parser page. You could interact with them, and they grabbed teh default value from
    the Python scripts.</p>
    <p>(11:05 AM EST) - The site broke when uploaded to GitHub pages because of how local hosting and Github Pages interact with line breaks. This will not be the
    last time this problem happens.</p>
    <p>(11:21 AM EST) - My fix for GitHub Pages broke locally hosting the site. I fixed it here.</p>
    <p>(11:49 AM EST) - The descriptions of options formatted weirdly, I fixed it here.</p>
    <p>(12:37 PM EST) - The sliders now have their value displayed.</p>
    <p>(9:25 PM EST) - Choice option types now worked on the AP Parser. I also added more Miku theming to the main page.</p>
    <p>(10:35 PM EST) - The Miku theming is now toggled by a button on the main page.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>3/4/24</h3>
    <p>(12:05 PM EST) - Website is created.</p>
    <p>(1:37 PM EST) - The AP Parser site has a feature prototyped, it displays a file that's uploaded to the website. This functionality goes unused because I
        pivoted from having the user upload their own Options.py to storing them on the site.</p>
